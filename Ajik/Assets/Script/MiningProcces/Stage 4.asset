  miningName: Material Removal
  miningDescription: 'Material Removal: is the process of relocating excavation debris
    from the land clearing activities using excavation equipment such as backhoe
    excavators or shovels from loading points to designated disposal areas determined
    by the coal mining company. Covering soil can be done in two ways: backfilling
    and direct dumping. Backfilling is an effective method to reduce the acidity
    content from mining activities or previously used mining land.'
